The following pdf-file contains a student-oriented research work report with the topic: "sTGC (small-strip Thin Gap Chamber) defects detection technique". It's written in Russian, but You can learn about it from the abstract below.

**Abstract:**
Small-strip Thin Gap Chamber (sTGC) is a coordinate detector, used in ATLAS experiment. This detector is a descendant of another detector - Thin Gap Chamber (TGC). STGC started to be used in ATLAS experiment after The New Small Wheel Upgrade to increase the detector stability for HL-LHC (High Luminosity section for Large Hadron Collider). Various techniques were used to reveal different sTGS defects before its usage in ATLAS experiment (or will be used in other experiments in future). Some of these techniques are better at one task, some at another. This project describes the application of the x-ray scanning technique for the sTGC detectors, produced in Weizmann Institute of Science. This test relies on using x-ray scanner to irradiate the surface of detector to find so-called "hot" and "cold" areas. An area consider to be called "hot" or "cold" requires to show many (according to other areas of the same detector) events of overcoming (or losing) an average output current value through the detector. This project results show the usage of this technique by finding such areas of the sTGC detectors, produced in Weizmann Institute of Science.
